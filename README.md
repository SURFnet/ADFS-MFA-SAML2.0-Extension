# ADFS-MFA-SAML2.0-Extension

This is a MFA extension for Microsoft ADFS 3.0 and 4.0 that authenticates a user's second factor in OpenConext Stepup. It uses the second factor only (SFO) endpoint of the Stepup-Gateway to authenticate the user.

## Installation

### Requirements

* This version of the plugin requires version 2.7.0 of the Stepup-Gateway
* Installation of the ADFS-MFA extension on the ADFS Server requires domain administrator privileges
* The installation script requires the PowerShell ExecutionPolicy to be set to "unrestricted"

### Precompiled versions
Precompiled versions of the extension can be downloaded from the [github releases page](https://github.com/SURFnet/ADFS-MFA-SAML2.0-Extension/releases). Note that these prebuild versions are targeted to SURFconext, and contain SURFconext specific configuration. There are two different versions of the extension that use different methods to authenticate to the Stepup-Gateway.

| 0.1     | [SetupPackage.zip](https://github.com/SURFnet/ADFS-MFA-SAML2.0-Extension/releases/download/0.1/SetupPackage.zip) | This release requires the "Authentication Service"                                                                              |
| 0.2     | [SetupPackage.zip](https://github.com/SURFnet/ADFS-MFA-SAML2.0-Extension/releases/download/0.2/SetupPackage-0.2.zip) | This release works with the Stepup-Gateway directly and dus not use the AuthenticationService. It Requires Stepup-Gateway 2.7.0 |

These instructions are for version 0.2.

Unpack the .zip file on the ADFS server. If you have an ADFS farm, you will need to install the extension on each ADFS server in the farm.

| ServiceProvider | EntityId                        | Yes       | The SAML EntityID of the of the SAML Service Provider (SP) of the extension. We do _not recommend_ to reuse the EnitytID of the ADFS server. This is an identifier. We recommend that you us an identifier that is linked to a domain you control and that identifies the purpose of the SP. E.g. "http://example.org/scsa-mfa-extension". |
| ServiceProvider  | SigningCertificate             | No       | Optional. If present this is the filename of a .pfx file that contains the SAML Signing certificate and RSA keypair of the SAML Service Provider (SP) of the extension. We do _not recommend_ to reuse the SAML signing or the TLS server certificate of the ADFS server here. When not present a new self signed X.509 certificate is created by the install script, and written to disk and to this configuration file so it can be used to install the extension on other ADFS servers in the farm, or to reinstall the extension |
| IdentityProvider | EntityId                       | Yes      | The EntityID of the SFO endpoint of the Stepup-Gateway |
| IdentityProvider | Certificate                    | Yes      | Filename of the file with the SAML Signing certificate of the Stepup-Gateway. |

### Install the extension

Run Install-SurfnetMfaPlugin.ps1 as a domain administrator from the power shell. The installation process will restart the AD FS service.

The power muts have ExecutionPolicy "unrestricted":
```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
```

Run the installation PowerShell script:
```powershell
SurfnetMfaPlugin.ps1
```

To set the ExecutionPolicy back to its original state
```powershell
Set-ExectionPolicy restricted
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

### Known issues and troubleshooting

#### Logging
The Event Viewer contains two locations with log events that are useful for troubleshooting:

1. "Application and Services Logs" --> "AD FS" --> "Admin"
2. "Application and Services Logs" --> "AD FS Plugin"

#### SurfnetMfaPluginConfiguration.config
When running the install script again not all configuration from SurfnetMfaPluginConfiguration.json is applied. Workaround is to make the configuration changes manually in `C:\Windows\ADFS\SurfnetMfaPluginConfiguration.config`.

The extension does not use ADFS for SAML authentication to the Stepup-Gateway, but uses the [KentorIT](https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2) library. SAML configuration for the extension is not set through the "AD FS Management" console.

##### kentor.authServices
The "kentor.authServices" section contains the configuration of the SAML Service Provider library that is used by the extension. This section contains the SAML configuration of the SFO endpoint on the Stepup-Gateway IdP and SAML Service Provider (SP) of the extension. The SAML signing certificate for the SP is not stored here, but is set in "SURFnet.Authentication.Adfs.Plugin.Properties.Settings"

`findValue` contains the SHA-1 thumbprint of the SAML Signing certificate of the Stepup-Gateway IdP in the LocalMachine\My store of the user that runs the ADFS Service. Note that this thumbprint must be all uppercase. The other values were copied verbatim from the `SurfnetMfaPluginConfiguration.json` configuration file during the first installation of the plugin.

```xml
<kentor.authServices entityId="http://example.org/scsa-mfa-extension" returnUrl="" discoveryServiceUrl="">
    <nameIdPolicy allowCreate="true" format="Unspecified" />
    <identityProviders>
      <add entityId="https://sa-gw.surfconext.nl/second-factor-only/metadata" signOnUrl="" binding="HttpPost" allowUnsolicitedAuthnResponse="false" wantAuthnRequestsSigned="true">
        <signingCertificate storeName="My" storeLocation="LocalMachine" findValue="1F459B2A6E598FBE8B6AA2D0E41D020FB999A2FD" x509FindType="FindByThumbprint" />
      </add>
    </identityProviders>
</kentor.authServices>
```

##### SURFnet.Authentication.Adfs.Plugin.Properties.Settings

This section conains the configuration for the SAML Service Provider (SP) of the extension. This is the SP that handles authentication to the SFO IdP of the Stepup-Gateway. It also contain the settings that the extension needs to find the user requiring MFA in the local Active Directory to get the identifier for a user for Stepup-Gateway

`SpSigningCertificate` contains the SHA-1 thumbprint of the SAML Signing certificate of the SP in the LocalMachine\My store of the user that runs the ADFS Service. The RSA keypair (i.e. the private key) of this certificate must be in the same store. Note that this thumbprint must be all uppercase.

```xml
<applicationSettings>
    <SURFnet.Authentication.Adfs.Plugin.Properties.Settings>
      <setting name="SecondFactorEndpoint" serializeAs="String">
        <value>https://sa-gw.test2.surfconext.nl/second-factor-only/single-sign-on</value>

      </setting>
    </SURFnet.Authentication.Adfs.Plugin.Properties.Settings>
  </applicationSettings>
```

### Building from Source

* This project uses the NuGet package manager. Before building you must Restore the NuGet packages (e.g. run "nuget restore" from the console).
* The KentorIT library needs to be signed. Run "SolutionItems/SignKentorAuthLibrary.cmd"
Compile this project as normal. When building in release modus, a SetupPackage.zip file is created. Use this zip file to install the AD FS plugin on the AD FS server. You should only add the public key of your SFO endpoint to the zip and set the environment specific variables in the configuration file.
